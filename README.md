# E0102
UCSD Affiliated Research Project Studying Supernova Dust Production in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
## Additional Required Dependencies. 
To run code from scratch, you must install opencv and reproject.
```
pip install opencv-python reproject
```
*Assuming python3, may be slightly different for 2.7
## Original Files
Contains Infrared images from Spitzer and Herschel which are the primary observations for this project.  
  Also contains images of E0102 in the Radio and Xray for boundary determination. 
## Saturation Correction
The Spitzer 24 micron image has an oversaturated source far away from the remnant that disrupts convolution. 
  This code simply replaces that source with a box of NaNs. 
## Sky Remove
A region in each image at 24 microns (Spitzer) and 70, 100, 160 microns (Herschel) is selected that contains the least (closest to 0) amount of emission in the images while avoiding the edges. The region contains the same RA/DEC coordinates in each image. The median is taken of this region and subtracted from each image. The standard deviation of this region is saved and used later as a source of error during the SED fitting. 
## Convolve/Regrid
Folder contains all Kernels used for convolution. Kernels obtained from [Aniano+,2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5065).
## Background Removal
E0102 is located within a spatially variable background that must be considered before any measurements can take place.    
  
The four data points we are using to make the measurement include images at 24 microns (Spitzer) and 70, 100, 160 microns (Herschel).        
  
For the 24 and 70 micron images the resolution is good enough that we employ a non linear diffusion based inpainting method to model the background before removing it from the supernova.

Note that the fits files, and all but one of the gif files generated by the code in Background_Removal/Diffusion is not included in this repo to save room. Diffusion.py would need to be run first in order for most of the other code in this folder to work. Diffusion.py creates the final modeled background image where the other files are used for visualizing and understanding the results.
